# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

This project implements a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on certain medical attributes. The project uses a dataset that contains features such as blood pressure, insulin level, body mass index (BMI), and age. The goal is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a predictive model for diabetes diagnosis. It covers the following steps:

1. 🧹 **Data Preprocessing**
2. 🎓 **Model Training**
3. 📝 **Model Evaluation**
4. 🔮 **Prediction System**

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various medical details, such as:

- 🤰 Pregnancies
- 🍬 Glucose
- 💉 Blood Pressure
- 📏 Skin Thickness
- 🧪 Insulin
- 🏋️‍♀️ BMI
- 🧬 Diabetes Pedigree Function
- 🎂 Age

These features are used to predict whether a person is diabetic (`1`) or non-diabetic (`0`).

The data for this project can be found in the file named "diabetes.csv".

## ⚙️ Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the required Python packages. The required dependancies are:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. ScikitLearn

You can install this using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🚀 Usage

1. 📥 Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. 📂 Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file).
3. ▶️ Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. 🧮 Use the provided input data in the predictive system section to test the model.

## 🎯 Results

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately **77%** on the testing data. The training data accuracy is slightly higher, indicating that the model performs reasonably well but may have some degree of overfitting.
